# Student Management System (API Learning Project)

##  Project Overview

This project was mainly developed to understand how API calls work in a backend application.

The Student Management System demonstrates how REST APIs handle requests and responses using FastAPI. It focuses on learning:

- How API endpoints are created
- How HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) work
- How data is sent and received in JSON format
- How backend servers process API requests
- How interactive API documentation works

---

##  Purpose of the Project

This project is built for learning and practicing:

- API development concepts
- CRUD operations
- Backend server handling
- Request and response structure
- Testing APIs using Swagger UI

It is mainly focused on understanding API calls rather than building a full production system.
