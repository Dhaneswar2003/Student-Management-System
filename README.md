# Student Management System (API Learning Project)

##  Project Overview

This project was mainly developed to understand how API calls work in a backend application.

The Student Management System demonstrates how REST APIs handle requests and responses using FastAPI. It focuses on learning:

- How API endpoints are created
- How HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) work
- How data is sent and received in JSON format
- How backend servers process API requests
- How interactive API documentation works

---

##  Purpose of the Project

This project is built for learning and practicing:

- API development concepts
- CRUD operations
- Backend server handling
- Request and response structure
- Testing APIs using Swagger UI

It is mainly focused on understanding API calls rather than building a full production system.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- FastAPI
- REST API
- Swagger UI (Auto-generated API documentation)
- Uvicorn (ASGI Server)

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


### 2️⃣ Start the Server
uvicorn main:app --reload


### 3️⃣ Open API Documentation
After running the server, open:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

This allows you to test API endpoints directly from the browser.

## 📖 What You Will Learn From This Project

- How API calls are triggered
- How data flows between client and server
- How backend handles different HTTP methods
- How to test APIs without a frontend
- How JSON responses are structured

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Add authentication (JWT)
- Connect to a real database
- Add frontend integration
- Deploy to cloud platform
